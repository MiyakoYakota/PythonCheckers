## Requirements

Proxies Required: :ballot_box_with_check:

Proxies Supported: SOCKS5, SOCKS5 Authenticated

## Getting Started

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (add to path while installing).
- Generate a JWT guest session using ``python generateBearer.py`` and then place it into ``checker.py``
- Place your proxies into the same folder as the checker in ``proxies.txt``
- Place your combos into the same folder as the checker in ``combo.txt``
- Open your checker folder in PowerShell/CMD (``Shift+Right-Click`` ->`` Open in PowerShell/CMD``)
- Start the checker: ``python .\checker.py``

## Output:

Accounts are outputted into the following format:

```
{username}:{password}
```



## Other Info:

This login process is reverse engineered from their Android app. The login flow is as follows:

- Jane offers the client a guest session
  - Guest session is a JWT token that expires
- Client uses guest JWT token (aka `janeAuth`) to login
  - Device ID (`x-jane-device-id`) and Session ID (`x-jane-session-id`) are UUIDv4 IDs generated by the app. They can be random, but they must exist.
- Client POSTs `https://login.jane.com/login` with the fields `email` and `password`, no captcha required.
- Server returns a session ID (new `janeAuth`) which is used like a regular bearer token.
